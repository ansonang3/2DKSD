shapespace.py allows one to work in Kendall's shape space (in the 2D case),
extended to spline curves thanks to the Hermitian product Phi.

shapespace.py relies on the main script settings.py
but is not used by our KSD algorithm.

It defines:
    
    - the three distances d_F, d_P, and rho, also called full, partial, or geodesic distances.
    - some operations on the Riemannian manifold, such as exp(z,v), log(z,w), geo(z,w),
      and logarithmic or orthogonal projections on a tangent space
      
All functions are defined supposing z and w to be preshapes.

Warning:
    
    Mathematical shapes can only be numerically handled as preshapes.
    
    Hence the `shape' variable designates in fact a preshape
    (centered and normalized configuration), that is one of the many representatives
    of the equivalence class defining the corresponding (mathematical) shape.
